		WORKING WITH THE LAMBDA ENGINE DEVELOPER COMMUNITY

Looking into helping develop Lambda? Welcome! Even though you also have
to learn about the engine development through a technical sense, it is
extremely important to also learn how the community works and the
process of getting your code into the next release. These documents
will make it much easier for you to get your changes merged with the
least amount of trouble.
